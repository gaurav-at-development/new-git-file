<h1>About website</h1>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">We develop this website with the help of html and css. this is static type of website. we just use html and css <br>
    in this website.<br>
    A static web page (sometimes called a flat page or a stationary page) is a web page that is delivered to the user's <br>
    web browser exactly as stored,[1] in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application.
