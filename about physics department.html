    <p style="font-size: 30px;">
        Physics is a branch of pure science, dealing with the study and analysis of physical phenomena that take place
        <br>
        around us,the nature of the forces responsible for them, and accurate measurement of the physical parameters
        <br>
        involved, their interdependence and the laws governing them.<br>
        This leads to a better understanding of the universe we live in.
        <br>
        laboratory sessions are intended to give the students a hands-on experience of the experiments that enable the<br>
        verification of the knowledge gained in the theory classes. Problem solving hones the analytical and rational<br>
        thinking of the students in applying their knowledge to practical situations in life. A degree with physics as <br>
        one of the optional subjects equips a student to pursue a career in teaching. There is a plethora of research<br>
        opportunities available in various research institutions available in various Research Institutions of National<br>
        repute and placements in Research and Development Departments of Scientific Organizations.</p>
